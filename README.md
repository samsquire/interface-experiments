Interface Experiments
===

These are some experiments with user interfaces that I hope to integrate.

# 1. Multifile

Paste a directory structure and files and each editor edits the corresponding file.

 * Maybe can associate an area of a project with a list of files and switch between source sets?

Pointed at a directory index:

# 2. Spiral Site

'Scroll down' a webpage as if it were a spiral.

This is a spiral that you can scroll down:

Now each block can be spaced apart more and be a post on the webpage. At any given point only one post should be visible but posts should be visible in the background. When the user scrolls, the next one comes into view. If the user clicks the post in the distance, it will scroll into view.

# 3. Widgets Are text

Complex widgets on the screen can be converted into text for customization. Widgets can be represented by simple text formats and be piped together.

Simple text formats can be created for:

 * progess bars
 * trees
 * tabs
 * menus, menubars, toolbars

# 4. Nested Documents as Nodes

This is a mockup of the user interface described in this [living documents](http://samsquire.github.io/livingdocuments/) article.

# 5. Transpose Interface

When presenting large pieces of information it may be desirable to change the prioritized or focal point of the information being displayed without hiding or obfuscating it. Transpose interface allows the user to change the orientation of content so that it scrolls in a different way without losing access to it. In the following examples, there are two large documents. The user can read them one at a time by scrolling vertically like a conventional interface. Alternatively, they can choose to display both side by side by transposing the orientation from vertical to horizontal. They can now view the content by scrolling horizontally.

I am not longer interested in just this document. I transpose it by clicking it and the content moves up into the right.

I click the second document and now they are both transposed.
