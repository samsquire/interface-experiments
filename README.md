Interface Experiments
===

These are some experiments with user interfaces that I hope to integrate.

# 1. Multifile

Paste a directory structure and files and each editor edits the corresponding file.

 * Maybe can associate an area of a project with a list of files and switch between source sets?

Pointed at a directory index:

# 2. Spiral Site

'Scroll down' a webpage as if it were a spiral.

This is a spiral that you can scroll down:

Now each block can be spaced apart more and be a post on the webpage. At any given point only one post should be visible but posts should be visible in the background. When the user scrolls, the next one comes into view. If the user clicks the post in the distance, it will scroll into view.

# 3. Widgets Are text

Complex widgets on the screen can be converted into text for customization. Widgets can be represented by simple text formats and be piped together.

![As text](https://raw.github.com/samsquire/interface-experiments/master/astext.png "As text")

Simple text formats can be created for:

 * progess bars
 * trees
 * tabs
 * menus, menubars, toolbars

# 4. Nested Documents

This is a mockup of the user interface described in this [living documents](http://samsquire.github.io/livingdocuments/) article.
